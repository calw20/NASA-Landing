# NASA-Landing
This is just a simple landing page as I wanted something better then the stock-standard "You're all setup!" page all the web servers come with and I wanted something a bit different. So this page will grab you four random images from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day service.

This page was built on the "Twenty" template by HTML5 UP https://themewagon.com/themes/twenty-free-responsive-multipage-html5-template/
